# THYSHOP
Created an ecommerce website where customer can view, search, add to cart and delete items and checkout to place order.
## HOW IT WORKS
Clone the repository and activate the virtual environment and django server and then go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and you can use the shopping site.
### Frameworks and Libraries
I've used the django framework for the backend side of site and used jquery and bootstrap for the frontend side.
